Activity 6:
Design an algorithm to count the number of digits in a given number.
Example –
If the number entered is 12345
The output is 5 digits
In the number entered is 123
The output is 3 digits

Activity 7:
Design an algorithm which accepts a set of N (consider N to be 30) student’s examination marks (in the range of 0 to 100). Then make a count of the number of students that obtain each possible mark (i.e.; 
count of how many students scored 0, count of how many students scored 1, …. till count of how many students scored 100) 

Activity 8:
Design an algorithm which accepts a decimal integer and then displays its corresponding binary representation.

Activity 9:
Design an algorithm which accepts a binary representation of a number and then displays its corresponding decimal equivalent.

Activity 10:
Design an algorithm which accepts a number from the user and displays its smallest exact divisor other than one.
